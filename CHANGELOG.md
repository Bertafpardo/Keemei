# Keemei changelog

## Version 5 (2015-06-17)

Minor alpha release with several usability enhancements.

### Features
* Valid cells (i.e., those without any errors or warnings) are no longer colored green as this information wasn't important to display. The green coloring could actually detract from the ease of locating invalid cells ([#58](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/58))
* Users are notified when a sheet is completely valid (i.e., no cells have errors or warnings) via a pop-up box ([#57](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/57))
* Error and warning messages are prefixed with a label to indicate their type (e.g., "Warning: Empty cell") ([#31](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/31))
* Cells with leading/trailing whitespace characters are now flagged with a warning ([#4](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/4))

## Version 2 (2015-04-14)
Initial alpha release.
