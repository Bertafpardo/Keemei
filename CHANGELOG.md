# Keemei changelog

## Development version

### Features
* Valid cells (i.e., those without any errors or warnings) are no longer colored green as this information wasn't important to display. The green coloring could actually detract from the ease of locating invalid cells. [#58](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/58)

## Version 2
Initial alpha release.
