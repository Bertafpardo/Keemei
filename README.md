# Keemei

*Validate QIIME metadata in Google Sheets*

Keemei (canonically pronounced *key may*) is an open-source, BSD-licensed tool for validating [QIIME](http://qiime.org/) metadata stored in [Google Sheets](http://www.google.com/sheets/about/). It is written in [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) for easy integration with Google Sheets.

**Note:** Keemei is currently under active development and undergoing internal testing. Once complete, an initial public release will be installable as a [Google Sheets add-on](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/).
