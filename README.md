*Validate bioinformatics metadata in Google Sheets*

Keemei (canonically pronounced *key may*) is an open source [Google Sheets](http://www.google.com/sheets/about/) add-on for validating bioinformatics metadata, including [QIIME](http://qiime.org/) mapping files.

## Licensing

Keemei is available under the new BSD license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for Keemei's license.

Keemei uses the [SheetConverter](https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/custom-methods/sheetconverter) library, which is available under the 2-clause BSD license. See [licenses/SheetConverter.txt](licenses/SheetConverter.txt) for SheetConverter's license. The SheetConverter library is distributed with Keemei because [Google discourages the use of libraries in add-ons](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/publish).
