## Licensing

Keemei is available under the new BSD license. See [here](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/blob/master/LICENSE) for Keemei's license.

Keemei uses the [SheetConverter](https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/custom-methods/sheetconverter) library, which is available under the 2-clause BSD license. See [here](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/blob/master/licenses/SheetConverter.txt) for SheetConverter's license. The SheetConverter library is distributed with Keemei because [Google discourages the use of libraries in add-ons](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons/publish). Instead, they recommend copying the library code into the add-on and using it directly.
