## Why use Keemei?

Keemei provides an easy and interactive way to validate tabular bioinformatics files from within Google Sheets. It is meant to complement existing file format validation tools available in bioinformatics software by allowing users to validate their files without requiring the installation of additional software or exporting/importing their data for use in an external tool. Since validation is performed within Google Sheets, data management and validation can happen *in the same place*.
