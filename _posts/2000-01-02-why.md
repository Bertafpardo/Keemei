## Why use Keemei?

Keemei provides an easy and interactive way to validate bioinformatics metadata from within Google Sheets. It is meant to complement existing metadata validation tools available in bioinformatics software packages by allowing users to validate their metadata without requiring the installation of additional software or exporting/importing their data for use in an external tool.

Since validation is performed within Google Sheets, metadata curation and validation can happen *in the same place*. Keemei also provides an easy-to-use interface to help quickly locate, understand, and fix validation errors. These features are especially useful when there are a large amount of metadata, with many collaborators making frequent updates throughout the lifetime of the project. Additionally, collaborators involved in metadata curation may not always have access to existing bioinformatics validators, so Keemei provides an accessible and portable way to perform validation without requiring the installation of additional software.
