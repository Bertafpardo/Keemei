## How do I install it?

To install Keemei, click the image below to be taken to the Chrome Web Store:

<div style="text-align:center">
  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keemei/omlkdgglfkfnohablonafeabhbamjjoh?utm_source=permalink" target="_blank">
    <img src="img/web-store-badge-border.png" alt="Available in the Chrome Web Store" />
  </a>
</div>
<p></p>

Click the blue button with the plus sign (+) to install the add-on. You will be prompted to give Keemei permissions that are required to operate. Once authorized, you're ready to start using Keemei!

Alternatively, you can install Keemei from within a Google Sheet by clicking `Add-ons > Get add-ons...` and searching for Keemei.
